# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree(BST) is a data structure containing nodes. These nodes can be null or reference other nodes to the left or right of them. Each bst has a root/parent node.

- Left Node is always lower than its parent node
- Right Node is always higher than its parent node

Nodes in a bst can become their own bst within the overall tree.

- A bst is called "balanced" if every level is filled, except for the last one.
